Watch [this video on nodes and elements](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhvec8cXLlo)

What is the difference between an HTMLCollections and NodeLists? Are they arrays?

# Answer
Both are array-like objects but must be converted into an array in order to use array methods. HTMLCollections are specific to HTML and DOM methods while NodeLists can contain all types of nodes, not just HTML elements.
